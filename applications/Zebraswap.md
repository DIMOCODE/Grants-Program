## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
Zebraswap is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto
traders. DEXs fulfill one of crypto’s core possibilities: fostering
financial transactions that aren’t officiated by banks, brokers, or
any other intermediary.
Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs don’t allow for exchanges
between fiat and crypto — instead, they exclusively trade
cryptocurrency tokens for other cryptocurrency tokens. Offering
true decentralisation.
Decentralized exchanges are simply a set of smart contracts.
They establish the prices of various cryptocurrencies against
each algorithmically and use “liquidity pools” — in which
investors lock funds in exchange for interest-like rewards — to
facilitate trades.



### Overview

-A truly interoperable decentralised world.Welcome to the future of DEFI
-With the effective use of interoperable bridges, liquidity pools, and DEX aggregators we can tackle the liquidity dilemma along with providing cross-chain capabilities
-To tackle the bridge security issues many DEXs face, we will over collateralize these bridges to add an additional layer of security for the users
-The bridges are operated by a group of permissionless, decentralised bridge nodes that a re-elected every single month. These nodes collectively use a combination of
Secure Multipart Computation (sMPC) and Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) to collectively generate signatures to secure cross-chain assets.
- The Dapp will live and thrive on the Polkadot ecosystem connecting all parachains and all evm compatible chains along with bridges to non-evm chains too. The Dapp will incorporate key parachains to boost interoperability in the Polkadot ecosystem.
-The team strongly believes that the future of DEFI is interoperable and we aim to do just that by leveraging the sophisticated Polkadot technology and systems.

### Project Details

-Along with enabling key yield farms and cross-chain liquidity pools we will be Building bridges, which use an advanced version of the Lock-Mint-Burn-Unlock method
to transfer assets between blockchains. The bridges are direct bridges, meaning they require no intermediaries or relay networks to complete cross-chain transactions. Rather,
when moving assets from one blockchain to another, the assets are transferred directly from the source chain to the destination
chain. For example, when moving Bitcoin to Ethereum, the BTC is locked on the Bitcoin Network by the bridge nodes before wrapped BTC is minted on Ethereum. There is
no intermediary step or middlemen. The bridges are operated by a group of permissionless, decentralised bridge nodes
that a re-elected every single month. These nodes collectively use a combination of Secure Multipart Computation (sMPC) and
Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) to collectively generate signatures to secure cross-chain assets. This approach is far more secure than the multisig approach used by many
other cross-chain bridges. Additionally, this approach ensures that no single node or entity ever has access to a user’s assets.


### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

-The project fits right into the heart of the ecosystem by enabling true decentralization and interoperability not only for the crypto asset but also by making NFTs on the chain truly interoperable.
- Our target audience is the entirety of the Polkadot ecosystems, including parachains, users, tokens, and NFT marketplaces.
- The Dapp meets a key need of fostering financial transactions that aren't officiated by banks, brokers, or any other intermediary. Along with making the ecosystem so flexible that other Dapps can also use these bridges to have a direct link to the Polkadot ecosystem.
- There is a handful of Dapp's on the Polkadot ecosystem all solving different purposes very efficiently however we aim to be different by:
  - Current similar Dapps  and their hurdles:
  - Current DEXs are not capable of supporting a wide range of cryptocurrencies due to the lack of liquidity and interoperability
  - Due to the increase in transaction load, the DEXs suffer from prolonged order matching time. As the order matching is automated, no human intervention can speed up things
  - The current interoperable bridge solutions being built in the market, provide a lack of safety for users and lack security as they are susceptible to hacks due to the lack of collateralisation.
How we aim to solve this
-With the effective use of interoperable bridges, liquidity pools, and DEX aggregators we can tackle the liquidity dilemma along with providing cross-chain capabilities
-Instead of using a normal order book method we will implement a smart AMM model to cut the prolonged matching time to practically zero.
-To tackle the bridge security issues many DEXs face, we will over collateralize these bridges to add an additional layer of security for the users

educational infrastructural development and investment procurement for companies. Thakkar went to Australia and New Zealand for his studies, and he is known for his staunch and ethical approach, which has earned him global recognition

Priyank Vyas
_Chief Architect_

Priyank Vyas is one of the founding members of DIMO and XDSea, and the Chief Architect for both ventures. Priyank pursued his computer science graduation in New Zealand. Gaining research experience at a young age with a publication to his name, Priyank has research-oriented ambitions and wants to incorporate novelty in every project. He started his career in Data Stream Mining and Machine Learning (ML) on Distributed Systems, developing a soon-to-be open-source ML tool for Apache Spark. Following that, Priyank delved into the world of blockchain and dApp development, joining Sarthak and Bhavesh in XDSea and other ventures. His team has gained renown for their continued innovation and upkeep of their projects.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:
The Dapp will be using a combination of the following languages and frameworks:


For Smart contract and internal frameworks
-Solidity 
-Python
-C++ 
-JavaScript
-Shell 

For Front and Back-end
-Angular
-React 
-Mongo DB


### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 150-180 Days  
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  5 FTFE
- **Total Costs:** 10000 USD 

### Milestone 1 The Tech — Implement infrastructure along with bridges

- **Estimated duration:** 60-100  Days 
- **FTE:**  5
- **Costs:** 6000 USD

All of the  bridges are operated by a group of permissionless, decentralised bridge nodes that are re-elected every single month. These nodes collectively use a combination of Secure Multipart Computation (sMPC) and Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) to collectively generate signatures to secure crosschain assets. This approach is far more secure than the multisig approach used by many other crosschain bridges. Additionally, this approach ensures that no single node or entity ever has access to a user’s assets.

The Zebraswap will bridges also support a number of non-EVM networks. This means that traditionally isolated assets like BTC, LTC, XRP and DOT, just to name a few, can be transferred to blockchains with vibrant DeFi ecosystems like Ethereum, Avalanche,  and Fantom, the list is endless. With Zebraswap we aim to do just that, by having a these vibrant ecosystems move over to our platform on polkadot.

For the Lock-Mint-Burn-Unlock method to work, three main smart contracts are deployed: one on source chain to handle source assets, one on target chain to handle target assets, and one on a managing chain to handle registration and staking of bridge nodes. ) |

## Future Plans

Our vision is to connect one chain at a time through our dex making it a go-to DEFI house. To make this happen we will be heavily focused on the key factors.

- Constant innovation through technology deployment and integrations
- Integration with key dapps on Polkadot as well as other blockchains for users to have a wider choice
-Community engagement is crucial for us and at the top of our priority: while we will be using a different array of business strategies not limiting to Bounty campaigns, Airdrops, Trading events, and press
Release, influencer onboarding, etc. We strongly believe in DIP: DIMO Improvement Proposals, where the community takes an active role in the development of the Dapp so that it becomes a Dapp that is for the community, by the community.

| Future update 1. | NFT Bridges | Facility for NFT swaps on the platform |
| Future update 2. | NFT x DEFI  | Features like staking, renting, and leasing NFTs on the platform 
| Future update 3. | Exchange Integrations | Integrating DEFI Aggregators and exchanges to boost liquidity and have the concept of "imported" liquidity pools.
